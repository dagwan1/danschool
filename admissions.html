          education to students from early childhood to adolescence and young adulthood – ages 2 to 18. BISW is
          academically non-selective because we believe that no child has a limit to their potential.</p>
    
        <p>However, when considering applicants, we look to see if they share our values of respect, tolerance, and
          open-mindedness, and whether we can help their individual needs to ensure they receive the best possible
          education.</p>

        <div class="button-to-expan-text">
          <h5>How large is your school, and what are your class sizes?<button class="expand">+</button></h5>
          <p>
            The British International School of Washington has around 550 students enrolled on average. Typically, each
            year group has approximately 35 to 45 students enrolled. These numbers tend to be smaller for our youngest
            learners in our Early Years program as well as our oldest learners in the International Baccalaureate
            Diploma Program. Class sizes can range from 12 to 22 students, depending on the year group and the course subject.
            The average student:teacher ratio also varies depending on the year group.</p>
          <p>See the specific student-to-teacher ratio for each year group, below.</p><br>
          <p>Early Years</p>
          <p>Pre-Nursery (2 years old)</p>
          <p>1:4 student-to-teacher ratio</p><br>
          <p>Nursery (3 years old)</p>
          <p>1:8 student-to-teacher ratio</p><br>
          <p>Reception (4 years old)</p>
          <p>1:10 student-to-teacher ratio</p><br>
          <p>Primary School</p>
          <p>The average size of each year group in BISW's primary school is 36. We divide each group into two
            (sometimes three) classrooms for an average of 18 students per classroom.</p><br>
          <p>Years 1–2</p>
          <p>Each class has a classroom teacher and learning assistant, and students see specialist teachers each week.
          </p><br>
          <p>Years 3–6</p>
          <p>In addition to the classroom teacher, students see specialist teachers each week.</p><br>
          <p>Secondary School</p>
          <p>The average size of each year group in BISW's secondary school is 36. Students in Years 7–13 typically have
            an average class size of 14–24 students. The class size is dependent upon the course and the total number of
            students per year group.</p>

        <div class="button-to-expan-text">
          <h5>Do you take mid-year enrollments? <button class="expand">+</button></h5>
          <p>
            Yes, we take rolling admissions and mid-year enrollments. This makes the admissions process as
            straightforward as possible for families from all around the world who want to join our school community.
            Also, with our rolling admissions, you can apply anytime and expect that our school leaders will review your
            child's application quickly. Contact our Admissions Department at admissions@dnpsabuja.org to speak to a
            representative who can provide guidance on our admissions process.</p>

        <div class="button-to-expan-text">
          <h5>What nationalities are represented in the student body?<button class="expand">+</button></h5>
          <p>
            25% of DNPS students are from Nigeria, 30% from the United Kingdom, 20% are from the United States, and the
            remaining majority
            include a wide variety of nationalities. Currently, we have more than 70 nationalities in our student body.
            The predominant backgrounds change from year to year, as global transitions lead new families to Abuja. For
            instance, we could have many students from the United Arab Emirates one year and then more students
            from Denmark the following year. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="button-to-expan-text">
          <h5>Where do your graduates usually go to college or university?<button class="expand">+</button></h5>
          <p>
            DNPS graduates often attend schools in the Nigeria, United Kingdom, the United States, Europe, and Canada.
            We also
            see students choose universities in other exciting international locations. </p>
        </div>


        <div class="button-to-expan-text">
          <h5>What is the average length of time students attend DNPS<button class="expand">+</button></h5>
          <p>
            As an international school in Nigeria, Abuja, we acknowledge that many of our families will be with us for a
            limited time, so the length of time students attend DNPS can vary widely. On average, we see families join
            DNPS for 3 to 5 years. Some students stay for one or two years; however, we have also had students remain
            with us all the way from Pre-Nursery to Year 13. We remain flexible to offer our world-class education to as
            many students as possible. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="button-to-expan-text">
          <h5>What is the average length of time teachers stay at DNPS?<button class="expand">+</button></h5>
          <p>
            The faculty at DNPS consists of world-class teachers, and our teachers typically stay for several years.
            Exceptionally, some teachers have been with us for more than 20 years. Because we are both part of Nord
            Anglia Education and located in a highly desirable place, we have a vast pool of highly talented,
            world-class candidates to hire from. </p>

          <p>
            DPNS implements Nord Anglia Education's "Create Your Future" approach to teaching. We are committed to
            developing children's minds, relationships, and their understanding of their place within their community
            and the world at large. Your child will leave our school with everything they need for success, no matter
            what they choose to do or be in life. We achieve this by educating children to become: </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Lifelong learners who are principled and empathetic;</li>
            <li>Tolerant and sensitive members of the school and community;</li>
