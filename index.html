          <h1>NO TWO STUDENTS LEARN THE SAME WAY</h1>
          <p>We place each student at the center of their own learning experience. Teachers consider learning styles as

            challenge, growth, and success.</p>
          <p>Our approach is based on the latest education research. BISW teachers challenge and stretch students'
            abilities through teacher-led and student-led learning across individual and group activities. Your child
            will be inspired to go beyond the books and truly engage with their personal learning journey.</p>
          <p>We don’t stop at just <a href="{{ url_for('academicsuccess') }}">academic success</a>. Our approach is
            designed to develop your child into a socially-confident global citizen. We foster leadership skills,

              and resources to measure you child’s academic growth.</p>

            <p>At the heart of it all, we're developing our students' lifelong love of learning in a place where they
              feel comfortable and supported to grow into their best selves – and this naturally gives them the
              motivation and resilience to eventually go on to their first-choice university.</p>

            <p>Our teachers have the latest research in education at their fingertips, and they also know that no two

            <p>Under our world-class curricula, our teachers lead lessons by a topic or theme that encourages our
              students to think across different subjects. For example, we might have a lesson that connects English,
              science, and art.</p>
            <p>In response to these classroom challenges, our students learn to think outside the box! Our students also
              benefit from being in the heart of Washington, DC when they apply their thoughts beyond the classroom – as
              we can frequently take inspiring morning, afternoon, or full-day trips to amazing sites in the city (like
              world-class museums or parks), and can easily get involved with community service activities, too.</p>

            <p>We want your child to be excited when challenged. We'll support your child through their growing body,
              mind, and heart with fun opportunities like extended overnight trips. Year 2 students have stayed
              overnight in Delaware, for example, while Years 7–9 have attended the North Bay Adventure Camp in
              Maryland. Years 10 and 11 have gone camping in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains. And our Year 12 students
              take a service trip each year to spend ten days helping with local construction projects and other

            <p>DNPS has a special curriculum for each student to develop their social purpose – that’s what motivates
              them
              to become a positive agent of change within the world around them. We collaborate with UNICEF and local
              impact programs so that your child grows tremendously and recognizes their place in the world.

            <p>At DNPS, we’ll open your child’s eyes to the world around them so that they can one day become the future
              leader that our world needs. We educate our students about the rights of children around the world through
              our global partnership with UNICEF, for instance, and also work on exciting initiatives in response to the
              UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

            <p>Our students’ opportunities to explore social impact are particularly built into the IB Diploma
              Programme’s
              CAS (Creativity, Activity, and Service) component as well as our (ToK) Theory of Knowledge student-led
              service projects. We connect your child to communities with authentic needs, whether close to home or on
              the
              other side of the world.</p>

            <p>Locally, at DNPS, our IB students are making a difference: they’re volunteering in hospitals, organizing
              car
              washes for hurricane relief, and creating art for fundraising for charities like Martha’s Table, Diaper
              Bank
              DC, So Others Might Eat, and Bread for the City. Internationally, they’re also assisting populations in
              need.</p>

            <p>Because DNPS is located in the beautiful neighborhood of Georgetown, we’re right next door to Dumbarton
              Oaks National Park – our students’ favorite natural space to explore and relax in – and nearby world-class
              museums that inspire our students with their immersive events, exhibits, and more. We love to take
              advantage
              of the city we live in, so we’ll expand on our classroom activities by going to exciting sites in the
              city.
              Your child will forget they’re even learning!</p>

            <p>Inside our school building, our learning spaces are warm, open, and designed for the future as we’re
              always
              looking to encourage seamless connections between students and staff. </p>

            <p>We’ll also quickly connect our parents to our students’ success and achievement through our online
              platforms, such as SeeSaw, where our teachers can communicate with parents and students can showcase what
              they’re proud of, for both teachers and parents to talk about.</p>
